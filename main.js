I've messed around with the hammer editor for many years, often creating deathmatch or mini-game levels. I began by sketching the level; the first part of the level I designed was actually the garage, featuring a spawn to spawn duel from opposing ramps. The garage itself features many 1v1 level elements to create a unique and exciting start to each round. Click on this project to see more about the design.",
