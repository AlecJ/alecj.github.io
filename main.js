I also learned CSS Grid while making this site, in lieu of flexbox which I usually use. The focuses were on creating a responsive site with CSS Grid (take a look at it in mobile!) and finally having a place to display my projects as I apply to jobs. I used some animations (header and background waves), embedded twitter and instagram, and made a lightbox viewer to expand project photos.",

I've messed around with the hammer editor for many years, often creating deathmatch or mini-game levels. I began by sketching the level; the first part of the level I designed was actually the garage, featuring a spawn to spawn duel from opposing ramps. The garage itself features many 1v1 level elements to create a unique and exciting start to each round. Click on this project to see more about the design.",
