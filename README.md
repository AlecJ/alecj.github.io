* block out projects
* background color for projects
* fix project image on small screens

## To Do

* restyle header

* projects - add new info
* projects - github link (just a github logo)
* projects - link to site (if applicable)

* embed html from other document into div
* extended page for de_bug
* projects - text indicating click to see more
* slide out screen for 'see more'



* youtube - video embed

## Header
should resemble tabs somehow - page is pulled from right side of screen
maybe go left and right

## Project
clicking on a project pulls a tab from right side of screen with info

## Projects page
list of thumbnails with 1 sentence description
click on one
left slide in, vertical list of all projects
right slide in, page for project
